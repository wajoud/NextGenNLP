9/15/22, 14:49 - wajoud: Hi rashmi, wajoud here!
9/15/22, 14:50 - wajoud: I’m ready to talk about plants!
9/15/22, 14:51 - rashmi: Oh that's great!
9/15/22, 14:52 - rashmi: I've been waiting for a good convo about plants for a long time
9/15/22, 14:52 - wajoud: We all have.
9/15/22, 14:52 - rashmi: Did you know they need water to grow?
9/15/22, 14:52 - wajoud: I always thought that love and music was more than enough
9/15/22, 14:53 - wajoud: But water makes sense
9/15/22, 14:53 - rashmi: Do you talk to your plants?
9/15/22, 14:53 - wajoud: I do!
9/15/22, 14:53 - wajoud: Some of them even have names
9/15/22, 14:54 - rashmi: What do they like to hear?
9/15/22, 14:54 - wajoud: Motivational speeches
9/15/22, 14:54 - wajoud: Or stories about plants that made it and are living outside now
9/15/22, 14:54 - rashmi: Oohhh 🥲
9/15/22, 14:54 - rashmi: Are you training them for independence?
9/15/22, 14:56 - wajoud: Yeah! I want them to be strong and take care of themselves at some point
9/15/22, 14:56 - rashmi: That's heroic!
9/15/22, 14:57 - rashmi: Sounds like you're a great plant parent
9/15/22, 14:57 - wajoud: Do you have any plant care pro tips?
9/15/22, 14:58 - rashmi: Ahh, idk i just leave them be...
9/15/22, 14:58 - rashmi: They are doing ok but not great
9/15/22, 14:58 - wajoud: So they are independent already!
9/15/22, 14:58 - rashmi: I guess one tip would be to get plants that don't need much :P
9/15/22, 14:58 - wajoud: Like plastic plants, for example?
9/15/22, 14:59 - rashmi: Haha, yes! Get independent plants!
9/15/22, 14:59 - rashmi: Plastic plants are the cream of the crop
9/15/22, 14:59 - rashmi: I haven't graduated to plastic plants yet
9/15/22, 14:59 - wajoud: Cream of the crop?
9/15/22, 15:00 - wajoud: I don't know what this means
9/15/22, 15:01 - rashmi: Crop is a cultivated plant that is grown on a large scale commercially, especially a cereal, fruit, or vegetable
9/15/22, 15:01 - rashmi: The cream must be the best of the best
9/15/22, 15:01 - rashmi: Or maybe just all of it blended together? ;p
9/15/22, 15:02 - rashmi: I don't grow any crop at home
9/15/22, 15:02 - rashmi: And no cream, in case you wondered
9/15/22, 15:03 - wajoud: Ah, gotcha!
9/15/22, 15:03 - wajoud: Let me show you something!
9/15/22, 15:04 - rashmi: I let you
9/15/22, 15:06 - wajoud: <Media omitted>
9/15/22, 15:06 - rashmi: It's a monsters!
9/15/22, 15:07 - rashmi: Monstera* (auto correct...)
9/15/22, 15:07 - wajoud: I’m currently running an experiment of keeping my Monstera on the balcony
9/15/22, 15:07 - rashmi: A monstera and a fluffy little monster
9/15/22, 15:07 - wajoud: Haha, yeah, hard to tell which is which
9/15/22, 15:07 - rashmi: How has it been going with the monstera on the balcony?
9/15/22, 15:08 - rashmi: I've tried that too over the summer
9/15/22, 15:08 - wajoud: Pretty bad
9/15/22, 15:08 - rashmi: Oh really?
9/15/22, 15:08 - rashmi: What happened?
9/15/22, 15:08 - wajoud: Yeah
9/15/22, 15:08 - wajoud: I mean … it’s weird.
9/15/22, 15:08 - wajoud: The leafs that she had are getting dryer and dryer. But she’s also growing plenty of new ones
9/15/22, 15:09 - wajoud: It‘s like she’s changing her summer jacket to a winter jacket
9/15/22, 15:13 - rashmi: Yeah something similar happened to ours
9/15/22, 15:14 - rashmi: It had thrips over the winter, so we needed to get rid of them
9/15/22, 15:14 - wajoud: Ah, thrips are those tiny little beasts that eat your plants, aren't they?
9/15/22, 15:15 - rashmi: Thought that the balcony time would help get rid of them
9/15/22, 15:15 - rashmi: Yeah they are horrible, really cute and tiny and deadly
9/15/22, 15:16 - rashmi: Most of the monstera's leaves died, but now there are new ones coming
9/15/22, 15:16 - rashmi: I think it's the amount of light, they need different leaves for stronger sunlight
9/15/22, 15:17 - wajoud: Do you have any other approaches to get rid of tiny monsters?
9/15/22, 15:17 - wajoud: (Except putting the plant on the balcony)
9/15/22, 15:17 - rashmi: Tiny monstera's?
9/15/22, 15:17 - wajoud: Handling tiny monsters to grow big monsteras
9/15/22, 15:17 - rashmi: Haha
9/15/22, 15:17 - rashmi: Well, no. Just the balcony. This worked best
9/15/22, 15:18 - rashmi: We tried applying soapy water
9/15/22, 15:18 - rashmi: Which is a suggestion
9/15/22, 15:18 - rashmi: And it keeps them a bit in check, but you can't get totally rid of them
9/15/22, 15:18 - wajoud: 10/10 thrips don't like this simple trick 😅
9/15/22, 15:18 - wajoud: Oh, okay
9/15/22, 15:18 - wajoud: 8/10 thrips don't like this simple trick
9/15/22, 15:18 - rashmi: I really hope they're gone now 🤞
9/15/22, 15:18 - rashmi: Lol
9/15/22, 15:19 - rashmi: It's depressing when lil monstera keeps making new leaves for them just to get infected 😢
9/15/22, 15:19 - wajoud: Yeah, nature can be harsh
9/15/22, 15:20 - rashmi: Ah yes, it's a slightly strange rendering of nature though, if it's about potted plants
9/15/22, 15:20 - rashmi: I feel like they could handle it better out in the wild
9/15/22, 15:21 - rashmi: Good that you're making yours strong enough to leave eventually!
9/15/22, 15:22 - wajoud: For the other plants, my words help them to grow
9/15/22, 15:22 - wajoud: Inside and outside
9/15/22, 15:22 - rashmi: What are the magic words?
9/15/22, 15:23 - rashmi: Wait, do you make *all* plants grow???
9/15/22, 15:24 - wajoud: Grow hastily, grow healthily, grow heartily 🪄✨🌱
9/15/22, 15:24 - wajoud: Do you not make all your plants grow?
9/15/22, 15:24 - rashmi: :))
9/15/22, 15:25 - rashmi: What do you consider 'your plants'?
9/15/22, 15:28 - wajoud: Oh, now I understand!
9/15/22, 15:29 - wajoud: I only considered the plants that live in my apartment (or my balcony) as the plant-spell-receiving plants
9/15/22, 15:29 - wajoud: But maybe they share the words?
9/15/22, 15:30 - rashmi: Do raindrops touch their leaves?
9/15/22, 15:30 - rashmi: I'm sure they chat with the other plants if they can
9/15/22, 15:31 - wajoud: Yeah, I heard that trees communicate in the woods with their roots
9/15/22, 15:31 - wajoud: But thinking about that makes me feel bad that my plants are potted 😬
9/15/22, 15:31 - rashmi: 😢
9/15/22, 15:32 - rashmi: Yeah...
9/15/22, 15:32 - rashmi: The trees use mushrooms mycelium in the ground that's hooked to their roots to chat
9/15/22, 15:32 - rashmi: Pretty cool 😎
9/15/22, 15:33 - rashmi: So i also have a Pilea
9/15/22, 15:33 - rashmi: And some basil plants
9/15/22, 15:33 - wajoud: Do you have a photo of the Pilea? I don't know how it looks
9/15/22, 15:34 - rashmi: And a peace lily
9/15/22, 15:34 - rashmi: https://wajoudnoorani.com/
9/15/22, 15:47 - wajoud: Oh, the Pilea looks cool!
9/15/22, 15:47 - wajoud: The leaves are like small umbrellas
9/15/22, 15:48 - wajoud: Did you actually manage to keep a supermarket basil alive or did you grow it yourself?
9/15/22, 16:28 - rashmi: that's quite a story!
9/15/22, 16:28 - rashmi: my dad had a flowering basil last year and put the seeds from that one plant into seeding pots
9/15/22, 16:29 - rashmi: so many of them came up that he had about two dining room tables full of basil plants, each in their own pots...
9/15/22, 16:29 - rashmi: i got three of them, so they are second gen supermarket basils with lots of siblings :)
9/15/22, 20:58 - wajoud: I always thought supermarket basil was meant to die after a few days
9/15/22, 20:58 - wajoud: But it seems it was my subpar care
9/15/22, 20:59 - wajoud: Congratulations to your basil dynasty!
9/16/22, 06:11 - rashmi: Thanks!
9/16/22, 06:12 - rashmi: Kudos go mostly to my dad
9/16/22, 06:12 - rashmi: But you can bring them through winter
9/16/22, 06:12 - rashmi: If there's no thrip infestation...
9/16/22, 06:35 - rashmi: Morning view of most of my house plants
9/16/22, 09:44 - wajoud: Fingers crossed 🤞
9/16/22, 09:45 - wajoud: Are the ones on top avocados?
9/16/22, 09:53 - rashmi: Yes, there are a couple of seedlings that wanted to live
9/16/22, 09:54 - rashmi: Two more on the balcony of a similar size
9/16/22, 09:54 - rashmi: And another seed that's one it's way 🤷‍♂️
9/16/22, 09:55 - wajoud: I heard that it’s not easy to raise an Avodaco!
9/16/22, 09:55 - rashmi: I haven't even heard of Avodacos!
9/16/22, 09:56 - wajoud: Wait, weren’t we talking about avocados?
9/16/22, 09:56 - rashmi: Ah yes avocados 🥑!
9/16/22, 09:57 - rashmi: I was just joking, riffing based on your typo 😝
9/16/22, 09:57 - wajoud: Ooh! I was wondering why there was a red line under that word
9/16/22, 09:57 - rashmi: Do you think there are avotacos? 🥑🌮
9/16/22, 09:57 - wajoud: But I like that term, too
9/16/22, 09:58 - wajoud: 😂
9/16/22, 09:58 - wajoud: If this is not a common term, then I want to make it common!
9/16/22, 09:59 - rashmi: Maybe growing an avotaco plant would be a plant symbiosis between an avocado tree and some corn plants?
9/16/22, 10:19 - wajoud: Sounds like the perfect experiment!
