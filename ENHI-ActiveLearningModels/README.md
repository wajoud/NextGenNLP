# ENHI-ActiveLearningModels

Welcome to the ENHI-ActiveLearningModels repository, where we explore baseline and active learning methodologies for English and Hindi language processing. This project aims to develop and compare models using both traditional and active learning approaches to enhance machine learning performance on bilingual data.

## Project Description

This repository contains experiments and results from testing various machine learning models on English and Hindi datasets. The focus is on understanding how active learning can be used to minimize annotation costs while maximizing model performance.

### Technologies Used

- Google Colab: For all computational experiments to leverage GPU/TPU support.
- Python: Primary programming language.
- Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn (specific libraries used should be listed here).
