# ChatGardenBot

Welcome to ChatGardenBot, where conversations grow naturally! This project is a simple, intuitive chatbot built in Python using the ChatterBot library. The bot is designed to simulate conversation and learn from a corpus of text through interactive sessions.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes ChatterBot's machine learning capabilities to provide responses based on the collected conversational corpus.
- **Dynamic Learning**: Trains on a custom text file and improves with each interaction.
- **Customizable**: Easy to train on any new dataset or expand with more complex conversational capabilities.
